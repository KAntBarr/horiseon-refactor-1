# Horiseon Webpage

## Description
In this challenge, I make multiple changes to the html and css files.

HTML Changes:
- changed the first div to a nav
- changed the rest of the divs to sections
- added an id, "search-engine-optimization", to the corresponding section
- changed the last h2 element into an h4
- changed the benefits section to an aside element

CSS Changes:
- matched the corresponding element changes to the element selectors
- consolidated multiple classes into a single selector using commas
- added comments to some css selectors
